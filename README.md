In the [video](https://youtu.be/3DmMreHJvyU), I walk through my progress of compiling the Lua virtual machine source code into WebAssembly (Wasm) using Emscripten. 
My goal is to embed Lua Wasm into RapidForge to allow users to execute Lua scripts without needing to install Lua on their host machines. Wasi-sdk attemp is in wasi-sdk branch
